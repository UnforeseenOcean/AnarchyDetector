To verify:
Install 7-zip.
Right-click on a file, then hover on CRC SHA menu. Click on SHA-1.
Copy and paste the result to a notepad, and compare them.
Automatic check can be done if you have a program (such as TeraCopy) that can read from the .sha file.

Or you can just upload the files to an online CRC check site.

Hope you find it useful.
