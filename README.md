# AnarchyDetector
AutoHotKey program that detects (probably) 99% of AnarchyGrabber malware


Please read the following thoroughly.

If the results are as follows, it means this:

NO: As far as this program can see, your Discord client is not infected.

UNSURE: What this program found was either there was a folder for AnarchyGrabber, or index.js was tampered with.

YES: The program found both the folder for AnarchyGrabber and found out that index.js was tampered with.

# Checksum
The SHA-1 checksum of the files are as follows (Do not use them if it doesn't match)

AnarchyDetect.ahk: `7F4B3466FB9311C490F78F9D2371AA3CB5205DD5`

AnarchyDetect.exe: `8432D21FB48D806B6F9889CD0451F3950717B85D`

To verify:

Install 7-zip.

Right-click on a file, then hover on CRC SHA menu. Click on SHA-1.

Copy and paste the result to a notepad, and compare them.

Automatic check can be done if you have a program (such as TeraCopy) that can read from the .sha file.


Or you can just upload the files to an online CRC check site.

Hope you find it useful.
